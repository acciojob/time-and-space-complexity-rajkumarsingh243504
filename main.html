	<h1>Exploring Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity remains reasonable even for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses to solve a problem. It's crucial to ensure that an algorithm doesn't consume excessive memory, especially when dealing with large datasets. In terms of space complexity, we often encounter the notation O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. This notation indicates that the space used by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size.</b></p>
